    Pallindromic Integer
  Filename:

  Problem Statement:
    You are given a space separated list of integers. 
    If all the integers are positive and if any integer is a palindromic integer, 
    then you need to print True else print False.
    (Take Input from User)  
  Hint: 
      A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same
      when its digits are reversed. 
      Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical"
      You need to develop using any and all and List comprehension
  Input: 
    12 9 61 5 14
  Output:
    True

  Problem Statement:
    Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop.
    It works on a list with sublists, which look like this:
        
    Order Number  Book Title  Author Quantity  Price per Item
    34587 Learning Python, Mark Lutz  4 40.95

    Write a Python program, You need to write a solution without using lambda,map,list comprehension first and then with lambda,map,reduce
    
    A) which returns Order Summary as a list with 2-tuples. 
       Each tuple consists of the order number and the product of the price per items 
       and the quantity. 
    
       The product should be increased by 10 INR if the value of the order is smaller 
    than 100.00 INR.

  Hint: 
    Write a Python program using lambda and map.
