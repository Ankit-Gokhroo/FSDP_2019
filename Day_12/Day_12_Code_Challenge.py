# Hands On 

# Find the mean, median, mode, and range for the following list of values:
# 13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13

import numpy as np
a=[13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13]
np.mean(a)
np.median(a)
from scipy import stats
stats.mode(a)
range=np.max(a)-np.min(a)

#Answer : Mean = 15, Median = 14 , Mode = 13 , Range = 21 - 13 = 8

  Problem Statement:
      To create an array of random e-commerce data of total amount spent per transaction. 
      Segment this incomes data into 50 buckets (number of bars) and plot it as a histogram.
      Find the mean and median of this data using NumPy package.

  Hint:
      Execute the code snippet below.

      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      incomes = np.random.normal(100.0, 20.0, 10000)
      print (incomes)
 
    outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values
