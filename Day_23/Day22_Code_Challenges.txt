Q1. (Create a program that fulfills the following specification.)
deliveryfleet.csv


Import deliveryfleet.csv file

Here we need Two driver features: mean distance driven per day (Distance_feature) and the mean percentage of time a driver was >5 mph over the speed limit (speeding_feature).

    Perform K-means clustering to distinguish urban drivers and rural drivers.
    Perform K-means clustering again to further distinguish speeding drivers from those who follow speed limits, in addition to the rural vs. urban division.
    Label accordingly for the 4 groups.
